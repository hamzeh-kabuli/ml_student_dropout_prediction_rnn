**Student Dropout Prediction Using Recurrent Neural Networks**


This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project aimed at predicting student dropout rates using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Conducted as part of Machine Learning coursework at London Metropolitan University, this project explores the potential of RNNs to model and predict dropout patterns in higher education institutions.

**Project Overview**

Student dropout is a pressing issue in education, impacting both student success and institutional reputation. This project leverages the power of RNNs to analyze sequential student data and predict dropout risks.

**Key Features**

Dataset: The project utilizes a dataset from a university in Afghanistan, comprising attributes like student ID, GPA, attendance records, and more.
Feature Engineering: Critical features were selected based on their influence on student performance, including GPA trends and attendance.
Model Implementation: A Simple RNN model was developed and tuned to capture temporal dependencies in the data, providing accurate dropout predictions.
Findings: The model highlighted GPA changes in the first four semesters as the most significant predictor of dropout, suggesting the need for early academic interventions.

**Technical Details**

Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, normalizing data, and creating time sequences.
Model Training: The Simple RNN model was trained using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness and generalizability.
Evaluation: Model performance was evaluated using accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and probability scores to assess dropout risk.
Ethical Considerations
The project adheres to strict ethical guidelines, ensuring data confidentiality and compliance with data protection laws. The model aims to support educational institutions in identifying at-risk students early, allowing for timely interventions to improve student retention and success.

This project demonstrates the potential of RNNs in educational data mining, providing valuable insights for reducing student dropout rates. Future work includes expanding the dataset and refining the model to enhance its applicability across different educational contexts.
